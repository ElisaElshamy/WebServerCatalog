# About

Video Game Catalog allows users to log in using their Google account to contribute to 
a catalog of video games.  Video Games are categorized by genre.  Box art upload is not 
available in this version and will be added at a later time.

# Install

Make sure you have all of the following libraries installed:

```
import random
import string

then run ```python database_setup.py``` to create the empty database videogames.db and
